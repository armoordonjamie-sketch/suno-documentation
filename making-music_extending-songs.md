# Extending songs with Suno AI Prompts

Many people using Suno AI prompts face difficulties when extending songs multiple times. This often results in uneven lyrics, weaker vocal quality, and a drop in the overall sound quality.

Solution: Apply effective strategies for extending songs with Suno AI prompts to ensure top-notch music production.

## Examples for Optimizing Suno Prompts:[](<#examples-for-optimizing-suno-prompts>)

Try different versions of Suno prompts for each part of the song and choose the best:

  * For example, extend verse 1 and chorus 1 with Suno prompts; then extend verse 2 and chorus 2; finally, extend verse 3, the bridge, chorus 3, and the end. Creating multiple versions of Suno prompt extensions allows you to catch and resolve issues early, leading to better song quality.



Use AI feedback to fine-tune Suno prompts for lyrics and song structure before finalizing:

  * If one version doesn’t work well, discard it and give the AI time to reset. This break can lead to improved results when you revise the Suno prompts.



Limit the number of Suno prompt extensions to maintain sound quality:

  * Keep the Suno AI extensions to a minimum, starting with the song and extending it only two or three times. This helps maintain the music’s quality and prevents it from becoming disjointed after too many extensions.



## Extra Tips for Improving Suno Prompts:[](<#extra-tips-for-improving-suno-prompts>)

  * Save any Suno prompt version that meets your standards by using the “get whole song” option, ensuring consistency in your track.
  * Experiment with the length of different song sections and adjust EQ settings in your Suno prompts to fit your musical style.
  * Engage with the Suno AI community to gather fresh ideas and refine your skills for creating better music with Suno prompts.
