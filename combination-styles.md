Combination styles

# Combine prompts together to create unique sounds

My favorite thing to do with suno is combine styles in prompts. Try generating the first 15 to 30 seconds of a song, then mixing up the prompt to create more dynamic songs.

Example suno prompt technique: Start with a vibrant violin solo, then extend the song into ethereal lo-fi dubstep.

### Example suno prompts to try[](<#example-suno-prompts-to-try>)

`Gentle, tranquil acoustic, deep blues` then change it up by extending with another prompt.

`Melancholic, introspective indie rock layered with bright pop elements` then mix it up by clicking extend using another prompt.
