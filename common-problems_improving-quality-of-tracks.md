# Enhancing Your Tracks: Reducing Suno Ambiance and Improving Audio Quality with Adobe Audition

In the realm of audio production, achieving a clean and professional sound is paramount. One common challenge producers face is dealing with unwanted ambiance or “sheen” that can muddy the clarity of a track. This is particularly true when working with AI-generated vocals or samples, such as those from Suno AI. In this article, we’ll delve into effective techniques using Adobe Audition to reduce Suno ambiance and enhance the overall quality of your tracks.

## Understanding the Challenge: What is Suno Ambiance?[](<#understanding-the-challenge-what-is-suno-ambiance>)

Suno AI is a tool that generates realistic vocals and audio samples using artificial intelligence. While it’s a powerful resource for producers, the generated audio often comes with an inherent ambiance or sheen that can detract from the clarity and impact of your tracks. This ambiance may include unwanted reverb, background noise, or artifacts that make the vocals sound less natural or prominent in the mix.

## The Solution: Using Adobe Audition to Reduce Sheen[](<#the-solution-using-adobe-audition-to-reduce-sheen>)

Adobe Audition is a professional audio editing software that offers a suite of tools for noise reduction, compression, and overall audio enhancement. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use Adobe Audition to minimize Suno ambiance and bring your vocals to the forefront.

### Step 1: Applying Adaptive Noise Reduction[](<#step-1-applying-adaptive-noise-reduction>)

**Adaptive Noise Reduction** is a powerful effect in Adobe Audition that analyzes the audio in real-time and reduces unwanted noise without significantly affecting the desired signal.

#### How to Apply:[](<#how-to-apply>)

  1. **Import Your Track** : Open Adobe Audition and import the audio track you wish to edit.

  2. **Select the Audio** : Highlight the portion of the audio where the Suno ambiance is most noticeable.

  3. **Access Adaptive Noise Reduction** :

     * Navigate to `Effects` > `Noise Reduction/Restoration` > `Adaptive Noise Reduction`.
  4. **Choose the “UnSuno” Preset** :

     * In the Adaptive Noise Reduction window, you’ll find several presets.
     * Select the **“UnSuno”** preset \(the last one in the list\).
  5. **Adjust Settings if Necessary** :

     * While the preset provides a good starting point, you may tweak parameters like Noise Floor, Smoothing, and FFT Size for optimal results.
  6. **Apply the Effect** :

     * Preview the changes by clicking the `Play` button.
     * If satisfied, click `Apply` to process the audio.



**Why It Works** : The “UnSuno” preset is specifically designed to target and reduce the characteristic ambiance associated with Suno AI-generated audio, effectively cleaning up the track.

### Step 2: Enhancing Vocals with Multiband Compression[](<#step-2-enhancing-vocals-with-multiband-compression>)

**Multiband Compression** allows you to compress different frequency ranges independently, which can help in bringing the vocals forward and adding punch to your track.

#### How to Apply:[](<#how-to-apply-1>)

  1. **Access Multiband Compressor** : 
     * Go to `Effects` > `Amplitude and Compression` > `Multiband Compressor`.
  2. **Select a Preset or Customize** : 
     * You can start with a preset like `Broadcast` or `Pop Master`, which are designed to enhance vocals.
     * Alternatively, adjust the bands manually: 
       * **Low Frequencies \(20 Hz – 250 Hz\)** : Slight compression to control bass.
       * **Mid Frequencies \(250 Hz – 4 kHz\)** : Moderate compression to enhance clarity.
       * **High Frequencies \(4 kHz – 20 kHz\)** : Adjust to reduce any remaining sheen.
  3. **Adjust Threshold and Ratio** : 
     * Set the **Threshold** to target the desired signal level.
     * Use a moderate **Ratio** \(e.g., 2:1 to 4:1\) for natural-sounding compression.
  4. **Apply the Effect** : 
     * Preview and adjust until the vocals sound more prominent.
     * Click `Apply` to process.



**Benefits** : Multiband compression tightens up the dynamics of your vocals, making them stand out in the mix without overpowering other elements.

### Step 3: Stem Separation and Advanced Vocal Processing[](<#step-3-stem-separation-and-advanced-vocal-processing>)

For more granular control, you can separate your track into stems and apply specific effects to the vocal stem.

#### How to Proceed:[](<#how-to-proceed>)

  1. **Stem Separation** :

     * Use software like **iZotope RX** or online services to separate your track into individual stems \(vocals and instrumentals\).
  2. **Duplicate the Vocal Stem** :

     * Create two copies of the vocal stem for processing.
  3. **Apply High and Low Pass Filters** :

     * **First Copy \(High Pass Filter\)** : 
       * Go to `Effects` > `Filter and EQ` > `Parametric Equalizer`.
       * Apply a **High Pass Filter** to remove low-frequency content.
     * **Second Copy \(Low Pass Filter\)** : 
       * Apply a **Low Pass Filter** to remove high-frequency content.
  4. **Compression** :

     * Apply compression to both copies to control dynamics.
  5. **Panning** :

     * **First Copy** : Pan hard left.
     * **Second Copy** : Pan hard right.
  6. **Add DeReverb** :

     * Go to `Effects` > `Noise Reduction/Restoration` > `DeReverb`.
     * Apply the effect to both copies to reduce any room ambiance.
  7. **Mixing the Copies** :

     * Adjust the levels of the panned copies to enhance stereo width and presence.



**Outcome** : This technique enhances the vocals by creating a wider stereo image and further reducing unwanted artifacts.

### Step 4: Adjusting the Instrumental Stem[](<#step-4-adjusting-the-instrumental-stem>)

The instrumental stem often contains residual ambiance or noise that can interfere with the clarity of the vocals.

#### Steps:[](<#steps>)

  1. **Reduce the Level** :

     * Lower the volume of the instrumental stem by **-3 dB to -15 dB** , depending on the content.
     * This reduction helps to minimize the impact of unwanted sounds without losing the musicality of the instrumental.
  2. **Apply Noise Reduction if Necessary** :

     * If the instrumental stem still has noticeable artifacts, consider applying noise reduction techniques similar to those used on the vocal stem.



**Tip** : Always listen critically to ensure that reducing the instrumental doesn’t negatively affect the overall balance of the track.

## Additional Tips for Optimal Results[](<#additional-tips-for-optimal-results>)

  * **Monitoring** : Use high-quality headphones or studio monitors to accurately hear the changes you’re making.
  * **Incremental Changes** : Make small adjustments and frequently A/B test against the original audio to avoid over-processing.
  * **Save Presets** : If you find settings that work well, save them as presets for future projects.
  * **Backup Originals** : Always keep a backup of your original tracks before applying destructive edits.



## Conclusion[](<#conclusion>)

Improving the quality of your tracks and reducing unwanted Suno ambiance is achievable with the right tools and techniques. Adobe Audition offers a comprehensive set of effects that, when used thoughtfully, can significantly enhance the clarity and impact of your audio productions. By applying adaptive noise reduction, multiband compression, and advanced vocal processing, you can bring your vocals forward and create a more polished, professional sound.

**Remember** : Audio editing is as much an art as it is a science. Don’t hesitate to experiment with different settings and techniques to find what works best for your unique tracks.
