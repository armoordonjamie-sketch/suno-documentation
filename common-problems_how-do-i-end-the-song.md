# How do I end the song?

These tips can help, but remember each generation is random. It’s better to pick a ‘good’ ending than to burn through credits hoping for a ‘perfect’ ending.

## Song Structure[](<#song-structure>)

Songs generate clips with endings after a full verse and chorus cycle. It can also resist ending if it has more of the cycle left to complete.

If the song ends abruptly within the 1st clip, you might need to structure the song with lyrics and metatags.

## Wrap up[](<#wrap-up>)

It can help to tell Suno to ‘wrap up’ the song in a final clip before trying to end it. Some known prompts and lyric tips:

\[Outro\] \[Refrain\] \[Finale\] \[Big Finish\]

### End Tags[](<#end-tags>)

These metatags might trigger the end of the song and stop the clip:

\[End\] \[Fade Out\] \[Fade Out and End\]

Use ‘end’ in the Style

A more aggressive method is to clear the Style and Lyric prompts completely, and prompt for an end only.

Clear the Style Prompt and replace it with the word ‘End’. Add an \[End\] tag to the Lyrics Prompt.

### Endless Loop[](<#endless-loop>)

Some genres might to settle into a loop that doesn’t progress, or an outro that never fades out. Trim the end of a clip, or create a manual fade-out with free audio editing software.
