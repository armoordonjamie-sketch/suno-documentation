# Complete List of Suno Voice Tags for Vocal Manipulation

When using Suno to generate music, you can creatively manipulate the structure of a singer’s voice with a variety of suno voice tags. These tags allow you to alter the tone, effects, pitch, and emotional delivery, making it easier to craft dynamic vocal performances that suit the mood and genre of your track. Below is an extensive list of suno voice tags that you can use to transform the vocal experience in your music.

## Important note[](<#important-note>)

Many of these suno voice tags are hit and miss. Instead, I’ve found a really good strategy is to use a vocal sample from [Splice](<https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=1.43168.2000000040&trid=1472494.201722&foc=16&fot=9999&fos=6>).

**From here you can:**

  1. Upload the vocal sample
  2. Extend the song but add in different lyrics
  3. Or try using the cover option.
  4. Use the suno voice tags to manipulate the vocal to get the sound you want
  5. Layer in more styles by repeating the process with different style prompts
  6. Get the vocal and instrumental stems and delete any vocals you don’t want
