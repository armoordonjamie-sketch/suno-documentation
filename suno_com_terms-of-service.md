Additional Terms: In addition, when using certain features through the Service, you will be subject to any additional terms applicable to such features that may be posted on or within the Service from time to time. All such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.

## Access and Use of the Service

Service Description: The Service is designed to process input data, information, and content that you provide in the form of code, video, images, information, data, text, software, music, sound and other audio, photographs, graphics, messages, and other materials and mediums (collectively referred to as the "Submissions") and generate and return audio and visual output based on those Submissions ("Output", and together with the Submissions, "Content"). The Service may include a public forum where Content can be shared in a productive environment with other users.

It is very important that you only upload, post, publish, or display (hereinafter, "upload(ing)") Submissions that you have rights to use and provide hereunder. By uploading any Submission, you represent and warrant that:

* you have, or have obtained, all rights, licenses, consents, permissions, power and/or authority necessary to submit and use (and allow us to use) such Submission in connection with the Service, including for the purpose of generating your Output.
* your Submissions and the use thereof by the Service, including to generate Output, will not violate any law or any third party's rights, terms and conditions associated with such Submission, and
* no other licenses, permissions, consents or authorizations must be obtained from or payments made to any other person or entity by us (or any third party deriving any rights or obligations from us) arising out of or related to our use of your Submissions, including to create your Output and/or to train, develop, fine-tune or otherwise improve the Service and any related artificial intelligence or machine learning models.

Suno Chat: As part of the Service, we may make available an artificial intelligence-powered chat assistant known as Suno Chat. You may only use Suno Chat to facilitate your creation and refinement of music and other Output via the Service, and not for any other purpose unless we allow otherwise in writing.

Your Registration Obligations: You may be required to register with Suno or provide information about yourself (e.g., name and email address) in order to access and use certain features of the Service. If you choose to register for the Service, you agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form. Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by our Privacy Policy. You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. In addition, if you are under 18 years old, you may use the Service only with the express consent of your parent or guardian, and you agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information as requested by Suno to confirm such express consent. We may, but are not obligated to, provide a free tier of the Service. You may not create more than one account to benefit from the free tier of the Service. If we believe you are not using the free tier in good faith, we may stop providing access to the Service. If we discontinue the Service, we will refund you any pre-paid fees on a pro rata basis, based upon the number of months left in the pre-payment period.

Member Account, Password and Security: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account details, if any, and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Suno of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session when accessing the Service. Suno will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph.

Modifications to Service: Suno reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that Suno will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

General Practices Regarding Use and Storage: You acknowledge that Suno may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Service, including the maximum period of time that data or other content will be retained by the Service and the maximum storage space that will be allotted on Suno's or its third-party service providers' servers on your behalf. You acknowledge that Suno reserves the right to terminate accounts (and all of their corresponding Submissions and Output) that are inactive for an extended period of time. You further acknowledge that Suno reserves the right to change these general practices and limits at any time, in its sole discretion, with or without notice.

## Conditions of Access and Use

User Conduct: You are solely responsible for any use of the Service and all Submissions that you make available to Suno, including by uploading Submissions via the Service or by emailing or otherwise making available Submissions to other users of the Service, and for any Outputs that you generate via the Service. You assume all risk associated with Submissions, including the transmission thereof, and you have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, legality and appropriateness of Submissions. The posting of Content on the Service by users does not indicate any approval or endorsement by Suno of such Content. Suno is not responsible for, and disclaims, any and all liability in connection with Content or any act of accessing, browsing, contributing to or otherwise using the Service. In no event will you use the Output to compete with Suno, including to create a competing product or service. The list below provides examples of the kinds of Submissions or uses that are illegal or prohibited by Suno. Suno reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against anyone who, in Suno's sole discretion, violates this provision, including removing the offending content from the Service, suspending or terminating the account of such violators, and reporting the violator to law enforcement authorities. You agree to not use the Service to:

1. submit, upload, transmit or otherwise make available any Submissions or direct the Services to generate any Output that (i) infringes any intellectual property or other proprietary rights of any party; (ii) you do not have a right to upload and use under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; (iii) contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment; (iv) poses or creates a privacy or security risk to any person; (v) constitutes unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, commercial activities and/or sales, "junk mail," "spam," "chain letters," "pyramid schemes," "contests," "sweepstakes," or any other form of solicitation; (vi) is (or is used for or in connection with any purpose, initiative, activity, product or service that is) unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, excessively violent, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, discriminatory, or otherwise objectionable; or (vii) in the sole judgment of Suno, is objectionable or which restricts or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the Service, or which may expose Suno or its users to any harm or liability of any type;
2. interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers or networks connected to the Service, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies, or regulations of networks connected to the Service;
3. violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law, or any regulations having the force of law;
4. impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state, imply or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity (including by generating, making available, promoting, labelling or otherwise using Output in a manner that suggests that such Output was created by or otherwise associated with an individual who was not the creator thereof);
5. solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18;
6. post any private information, or otherwise harvest, collect or disclose email addresses or other information about another user or any other person without his or her express consent or for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails or other unsolicited communications;
7. advertise or offer to sell or buy any goods or services for any business purpose that is not specifically authorized;

9. further or promote any criminal activity or enterprise or provide instructional information about illegal activities;
10. obtain or attempt to access or otherwise obtain any content or information through any means not intentionally made available or provided for through the Service;

12. circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade, or thwart any of the content protections in or geographic restrictions on any content (including Service Content (as defined below)) available on or through the Service, including through the use of virtual private networks; or
13. engage in or use any data mining, robots, scraping, or similar data gathering or extraction methods.

If you are blocked by Suno from accessing the Service (including by blocking your IP address), you agree not to implement any measures to circumvent such blocking (e.g., by masking your IP address or using a proxy IP address or virtual private network).

Fees: To the extent the Service or any portion thereof is made available for any fee, you may be required to select a payment plan and provide information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. You represent and warrant to Suno that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment instrument. You will promptly update your account information with Suno or the Payment Processor (as defined below), as applicable, of any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. You agree to pay Suno the amount that is specified in the payment plan in accordance with the terms of such plan and these Terms of Service. If your payment plan includes an ongoing subscription that is automatically renewed periodically, you hereby authorize Suno (through the Payment Processor) to bill your payment instrument in advance on such periodic basis in accordance with the terms of the applicable payment plan until you terminate your account, and you further agree to pay any charges so incurred. If you dispute any charges you must let Suno know within sixty (60) days after the date that Suno charges you, or within such longer period of time as may be required under applicable law. Details on our free and paid subscription offerings, including prices for paid subscriptions, are listed at https://app.suno.ai/account. We reserve the right to change Suno's prices. If Suno does change prices, Suno will provide notice of the change through the Service user interface, a pop-up notice, email, or through other reasonable means, at Suno's option, at least fifteen (15) days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. You will be responsible for all taxes associated with the Service, other than taxes based on Suno's net income.

Subscription Renewals and Cancellations: You agree that if you purchase a subscription, your subscription will automatically renew at the subscription period frequency referenced on your subscription page (or if not designated, then monthly) and at the then-current rates, and your payment method will automatically be charged at the start of each new subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future subscription charges, you must cancel your subscription seven (7) days before the subscription period renewal date by either cancelling your subscription within the account interface of the Site at https://app.suno.ai/account or by telling us via email at [email protected] that you want to cancel your subscription. Following any cancellation by you, you will continue to have access to the paid Service through the end of the subscription period for which payment has already been made.

Free Trial: You can sign up for a trail for the paid portion of the Service and your trial period starts on the day you sign up for the trial and lasts for the duration indicated on your free trial confirmation email (or if not specified, then 7 days). If you are on a trial, you may cancel at any time until the last day of your trial by either cancelling your trial within the account interface of the Site at https://app.suno.ai/account or by telling us via email at [email protected] that you want to cancel your subscription. If you do not cancel your trial at the end of your free trial period, and we have notified you that your account will be converted to a paid subscription at the end of the free trial period, you authorize us to charge your credit card or other designated billing method for continued use of the paid Service. You may, however, then cancel your subscription through the methods described above. If you cancel your trial account or decide not to purchase a paid version of the Service at the end of your trial period, your content or data associated with your trial account may no longer be available to you, and Suno may delete or remove any such content or data.

Payment Processing: Notwithstanding any amounts owed to Suno hereunder, SUNO DOES NOT PROCESS PAYMENT FOR ANY SERVICES. To facilitate payment for the Service via bank account, credit card, or debit card, we use Stripe, Inc. and its affiliates ("Stripe"), a third-party payment processor. These payment processing services are provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe terms and conditions and other policies available at https://stripe.com/legal and Stripe's Global Privacy Policy available at https://stripe.com/privacy (collectively, the "Stripe Agreements"). By agreeing to these Terms of Service, users that use the payment functions of the Service also agree to be bound by the Stripe Agreements, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. You hereby authorize Stripe to store and continue billing your specified payment method even after such payment method has expired, to avoid interruptions in payment for your use of the Service. Please contact Stripe for more information. Suno assumes no liability or responsibility for any payments you make through the Service.

Refunds and Cancellations: Payments made by you hereunder are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Suno.

Commercial Use: Subject to the Content Section below, unless otherwise expressly authorized herein or in the Service, you agree not to display, distribute, license, perform, publish, reproduce, duplicate, copy, create derivative works from, modify, sell, resell, grant access to, transfer, or otherwise use or exploit any portion of the Service, and any Output, for any commercial purposes.

You have control over the Push Messages settings, and can opt in or out of these Push Messages through the Services or through your mobile device's operating system (with the possible exception of infrequent, important service announcements and administrative messages). Please check with your wireless service provider to determine what fees apply to your access to and use of the Mobile App, including your receipt of Push Messages from Suno.

Mobile Software from the Apple App Store: The following terms and conditions apply to you only if you are using the Mobile App from the Apple Inc.'s ("Apple") App Store. To the extent the other terms and conditions of these Terms of Service are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of this paragraph, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in this paragraph apply, but solely with respect to your use of the Mobile App from the Apple App Store. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms of Service are solely between you and Suno, not Apple, and that Apple has no responsibility for the Mobile App or content thereof. Your use of the Mobile App must comply with the App Store's applicable terms of use. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Mobile App. In the event of any failure of the Mobile App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if any, for the Mobile App to you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Mobile App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by these Terms of Service. You and Suno acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of yours or any third party relating to the Mobile App or your possession and/or use of the Mobile App, including, but not limited to: (a) product liability claims, (b) any claim that the Mobile App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and (c) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

You must comply with applicable third party terms of agreement when using the Mobile App. You and Suno acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of these Terms of Service as they relate to your use of the Mobile App, and that, upon your acceptance of these Terms of Service, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms of Service against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.

Without limiting the foregoing, Suno and its designees will have the right to remove any content that violates these Terms of Service or is deemed by Suno, in its sole discretion, to be otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such content.

Content: You represent and warrant that you own all right, title and interest in and to Submissions, including all copyrights and rights of publicity contained therein, and that you possess all necessary rights or have obtained all consents necessary to grant Suno the rights and licenses herein. By using the Service or otherwise transmitting Submissions to us, you grant to Suno and our affiliates, successors, assigns, and designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up, sublicensable (directly and indirectly through multiple tiers), assignable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to use, reproduce, store, modify, distribute, create derivative works based on, perform, display, communicate, transmit and otherwise make available any and all Content (in whole or in part) in any media now known or hereafter developed, in connection with the provision, use, monetization, promotion, marketing, and improvement of our products and services, including the Service and the artificial intelligence and machine learning models related to the Service. For the avoidance of doubt, this license authorizes us to make your Content available to and sublicense Content to other users of the Service as necessary to provide the Service, and you further grant to Suno the worldwide, fully paid-up, sublicensable, assignable, perpetual and irrevocable right to identify to the public (both on and off the Service) that Output (or any of it) was generated via the Service. Such additional uses by Suno and other users of the Service is made without compensation to you or any other provider of the Submissions with respect to the Content, as the use of the Service by you is hereby agreed as being sufficient compensation for the Content and grant of rights herein. Furthermore, and for the avoidance of doubt, you irrevocably waive any and all so-called "moral rights" or "droit moral" that may exist in or in connection with the Content. You acknowledge that to the extent that you include personally identifiable information in the Submissions, we may republish such information. Although Suno has no obligation to monitor the Content, you acknowledge and agree that we may do one or all of the following: (i) monitor the Content; (ii) alter, edit, or remove any Content in whole or in part; or (iii) disclose any Content.

Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service , if you are a user who has subscribed to the Pro or Premier paid tier of the Service, Suno hereby assigns to you all of its right, title and interest in and to any Output owned by Suno and generated from Submissions made by you through the Service during the term of your paid-tier subscription. However, due to the nature of machine learning, Suno makes no representation or warranty to you that any copyright will vest in any Output.

If you are a user of the free or Basic tier of the Service then, you covenant and agree that you will only use Outputs generated from Submissions made by you through the Service solely for your lawful, internal, personal and non-commercial purposes, provided that you give attribution credit to Suno in each case.

If you are a user that activates features that permit other users of the Service ("Remixers") to remix your Outputs (each, a "Remix"), then you agree that all Remixes shall be a joint work owned jointly and equally by you and the Remixer to the extent that copyright vests in any such Remix. Furthermore, if you are a joint owner of a Remix generated by these Service features, and regardless of whether you are a free Service tier user or a subscriber to a paid Service tier, you additionally covenant and agree that the Remix may only be used for lawful, internal, personal and non-commercial purposes, provided that you give attribution credit to Suno in each case.

For the avoidance of doubt, Output may be publicly available in a third party application such as Discord, where it may be viewable, downloadable, and modified by other users of that third party application. If the Output becomes publicly available in such third-party application, you agree that other users have a right to access, display, view, store, modify, and copy such Output; provided, however, that you may change your settings to bypass these public sharing default settings so that Output generated will remain private.

Due to the nature of machine learning, Output may not be unique across users and the Service may generate the same or similar output for a third party. Other users may provide similar submissions and receive the same output. Output that is requested by and generated for other users is not your Content.

You hereby authorize Suno and its third-party service providers to derive statistical and usage data relating to your use of the Service ("Usage Data"). We may use Usage Data for any purpose in accordance with applicable law and our Privacy Policy.

* a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest that is allegedly infringed;
* identification of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works or other intellectual property are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works or other intellectual property;

Counter-Notice: If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in Content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

* your physical or electronic signature;
* identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
* a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content to be removed or disabled; and
* your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court located within Massachusetts and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Suno will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing them that Suno may replace the removed content or cease disabling it within ten (10) business days. Unless the owner of the applicable copyrighted work or other intellectual property files an action seeking a court order against Suno or the user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.

Repeat Infringer Policy: In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Suno has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at Suno's sole discretion, the accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. Suno may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Service and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.

## Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

1. Agreement to Arbitrate

This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms of Service as the "Arbitration Agreement." You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Suno, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, any Content, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and Suno are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

2. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief

YOU AND SUNO AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND SUNO AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.

3. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution

Suno is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at [email protected]. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Suno should be sent to 17 Dunster Street, Floor 4, Cambridge, MA 02138 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Suno and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Suno may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Suno or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Suno is entitled.

4. Arbitration Procedures

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, https://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

Unless Suno and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Suno agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.

5. Costs of Arbitration

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent any Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either Suno or you under the AAA Rules, Suno and you shall split them equally; provided that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees, Suno will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibit
