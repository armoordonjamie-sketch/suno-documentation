# Suno Community Guidelines

Last Modified: January 29, 2025

Thanks for making music with us! Before you dive into the creative community, we're sharing some important guidelines to help ensure Suno remains a positive, respectful, and inspiring place for everyone. Please take a moment to read through these guidelines carefully, and know we're here to answer any questions you may have. Check out our Terms of Use and Knowledge Base, and reach us at [email protected] if you need help along the way.

## Respect and Community

Suno is a global, open platform with a diverse group of people. We expect everyone to treat each other with respect:

* Be kind: Harassment, bullying, or abusive behavior will not be tolerated. If we find you're engaging in harmful activity, your account may be at risk of temporary suspension, permanent suspension, or deletion.
* Constructive feedback: We love honest opinions, but always focus on the content, not the person behind it. Feedback should be helpful, respectful, and kind.
* Respect privacy: Don't share others' private information (e.g., personal details, photos, health info) without their consent. Always respect others' privacy.
* No impersonation: Be yourself! While we support the use of stage names or professional identities, don't pretend to be someone else. Misleading others is against the rules.

## Intellectual Property

We respect the importance of intellectual property and copyright. Here's what you need to know:

* Your generated content will be seen:
  
  + If your material is set to Public, it will be visible on your page, and potentially featured on the Suno homepage.
  + If your material is set to Link-Only, it is not private. If you share the link, there's no way to take it back.
  + Features like Reuse Prompt are available to any user who has access to your song. If you don't want someone to potentially reuse your prompts, lyrics, etc, please consider this before sharing your links!
* Ownership vs Use Rights vs Copyright Protection:
  
  + Songs generated with a Basic plan are only available for personal, non-commercial use.
  + Songs generated with a Pro or Premier plan include commercial use rights. These songs can be uploaded to monetizing services, etc.
  + Suno cannot guarantee your local copyright office will protect your work. Currently, the US copyright office often chooses not to protect works made primarily with AI. You may still have protection over lyrics you wrote, but we encourage you to take precaution before assuming ownership and protections.

## Self-Promotion & Building Your Audience

We encourage creators to connect with their fans, but meaningful interactions are the key to success. Here's how you can promote yourself:

* Engage with your audience: Build genuine relationships, not just a following. Interact thoughtfully with fans and fellow creators.
* No spamming: Repetitive comments, aggressive following, or spamming behavior will result in warnings, suspension, or potentially account termination.

## Forbidden Content

While freedom of expression is important, there are certain types of content that shouldn't be part of the conversation. Please avoid posting:

* Sexual content: This includes explicit images or descriptions, and anything inappropriate for younger audiences (13+). We have a zero-tolerance policy for sexually explicit content targeting minors.
* Violence: Don't post content promoting violence, terrorism, or hate, including threatening behavior or glorifying harm.
* Hate speech: We won't tolerate content that promotes discrimination, hate, or violence based on race, religion, gender, sexuality, or other protected characteristics.
* False information: Misinformation, hoaxes, or fake content is prohibited.
* Illegal activities: Do not attempt to sell or promote illegal goods, services, or activities—this includes drugs, firearms, scams, or anything that violates the law.

## Spam and Prohibited Services

To keep Suno free of spam, here's what we don't condone:

* Commercial spam: Don't post content that's purely designed to drive traffic to external sites or promote a commercial service.
* Fake engagement: Don't create fake profiles, buy followers, or use bots to manipulate interactions on the platform.
* Malicious content: Posting content that could harm another person's device, privacy, or reputation is strictly prohibited.

## Reporting Violations

If you come across content that violates these guidelines, please report it to us. Here's how:

* Report content: If you spot something that breaks these rules, such as abuse or inappropriate content, use the report function directly on a comment or post. You can also bring this to the attention of our Discord help team, or write to [email protected].
* Fair process: We'll review all reports fairly and take action if necessary. Please note, some content you might find disagreeable may not necessarily violate our rules.

## Consequences of Violating the Rules

If you break the rules, we have the right to take action, which may include:

* Warnings: In the case of a first offense, we may send a warning rather than take action.
* Temporary suspension: In some cases, we may issue a warning or temporarily suspend your access to Suno before taking further action.
* Account termination: Repeated violations of these guidelines can lead to your account being permanently banned.

## Please Remember!

* Be respectful: Always consider the community before posting. We strive for a healthy and ever-growing community. Treat others the way you would want to be treated.
* Review the guidelines: We may update these guidelines from time to time, so check back regularly. This page will have an updated date any time a change is made.
