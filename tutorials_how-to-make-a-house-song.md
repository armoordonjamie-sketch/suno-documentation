## Crafting Your House Track with Suno[](<#crafting-your-house-track-with-suno>)

Now, let’s use Suno’s AI to generate the core of our house track:

  1. Start with a basic house prompt:
         
         Suno prompt: "Energetic house track, four-on-the-floor beat, pulsing bassline, uplifting synth chords"

  2. Generate a few variations and choose the one that best captures the house essence you’re after.




## Layering Elements for a Rich House Sound[](<#layering-elements-for-a-rich-house-sound>)

To create a full, professional-sounding house track, we’ll layer different elements:

  1. Add a groovy bassline:
         
         Suno prompt: "Deep house bassline, rhythmic and funky, complementing four-on-the-floor beat"

  2. Introduce melodic elements:
         
         Suno prompt: "Catchy house piano riff, uplifting chord progression, subtle arpeggiator"

  3. Create atmosphere with pads:
         
         Suno prompt: "Atmospheric house pads, subtle movement, creating depth and space"




## Adding Vocals to Your House Track[](<#adding-vocals-to-your-house-track>)

Many house tracks feature vocals. Here’s how to incorporate them:

  1. Find a suitable vocal sample on Splice \(e.g., a catchy phrase or vocal chop\).
  2. Upload the sample to Suno and use the “Extend” feature: 
         
         Suno prompt: "Extend house vocal sample, create catchy house vocal hooks, energetic and uplifting"




## Fine-tuning Your AI-Generated House Song[](<#fine-tuning-your-ai-generated-house-song>)

After generating your layered house track, listen carefully and identify areas for improvement:

  * Adjust the balance between elements using Suno’s regeneration feature
  * Ensure the energy builds and releases appropriately \(intro, breakdown, drop\)
  * Fine-tune the vocal performance if using AI-generated vocals



## Tips for Optimizing Suno Prompts for House Music[](<#tips-for-optimizing-suno-prompts-for-house-music>)

To get the best results when creating house music with Suno, consider these tips:

  * Specify house sub-genres \(e.g., “deep house”, “tech house”, “progressive house”\)
  * Include iconic house instruments in your prompts \(e.g., “Roland TR-909 drums”, “303 acid bassline”\)
  * Describe the desired energy and mood \(e.g., “euphoric”, “driving”, “hypnotic”\)
  * Reference classic house tracks or producers for inspiration
  * Use specific tempo ranges in your prompts \(e.g., “128 BPM house track”\)
