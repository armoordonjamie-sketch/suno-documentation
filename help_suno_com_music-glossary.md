## Tips for Using Musical Terms in Prompts

* Combine tempo terms with genres (e.g., "upbeat allegro pop" or "slow adagio ballad")
* Use dynamics to shape emotional intensity ("crescendo into powerful chorus")
* Specify instrumentation for desired textures ("sparse piano and vocals" vs. "dense orchestral arrangement")
* Mix structural terms to guide song form ("verse-chorus-verse with extended bridge")
* Layer production effects for atmosphere ("reverb-heavy ambient soundscape")
* Blend genres creatively ("jazz-influenced hip-hop with soulful vocals")

The more specific your musical vocabulary, the more control you have over your Suno creations!
