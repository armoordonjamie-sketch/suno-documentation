## Crafting Your EDM Track with Suno[](<#crafting-your-edm-track-with-suno>)

Now, let’s use Suno’s AI to generate the core of our EDM track:

  1. Start with a basic EDM prompt:
         
         Suno prompt: "High-energy EDM track, pulsing kick drum, electrifying synth leads, powerful bassline"

  2. Generate a few variations and choose the one that best captures the EDM essence you’re after.




## Layering Elements for a Rich EDM Sound[](<#layering-elements-for-a-rich-edm-sound>)

To create a full, professional-sounding EDM track, we’ll layer different elements using suno prompts:

  1. Add a powerful bassline:
         
         Suno prompt: "EDM sub-bass, deep and resonant, complementing the kick drum"

  2. Introduce melodic elements:
         
         Suno prompt: "Uplifting EDM synth lead, catchy melody, building tension for the drop"

  3. Create atmosphere with pads:
         
         Suno prompt: "Atmospheric EDM pads, creating depth and emotion in the breakdown"




## Creating Powerful Drops[](<#creating-powerful-drops>)

The drop is a crucial element in EDM. Here’s how to craft an impactful drop using suno prompts:

  1. Build tension with a rising effect:
         
         Suno prompt: "EDM build-up, increasing tension, white noise sweep, pitch-rising synth"

  2. Create the drop:
         
         Suno prompt: "Massive EDM drop, hard-hitting bass, energetic synth stabs, powerful drums"




## Adding Vocals to Your EDM Track[](<#adding-vocals-to-your-edm-track>)

Many EDM tracks feature vocals. Here’s how to incorporate them using suno prompts:

  1. Find a suitable vocal sample on Splice \(e.g., a catchy phrase or vocal chop\).
  2. Upload the sample to Suno and use the “Extend” feature: 
         
         Suno prompt: "Extend EDM vocal sample, create catchy vocal hooks, energetic and uplifting"




## Fine-tuning Your AI-Generated EDM Song[](<#fine-tuning-your-ai-generated-edm-song>)

After generating your layered EDM track, listen carefully and identify areas for improvement:

  * Adjust the balance between elements using Suno’s regeneration feature
  * Ensure the energy builds and releases appropriately \(intro, build-up, drop, breakdown\)
  * Fine-tune the vocal performance if using AI-generated vocals



## Tips for Optimizing Suno Prompts for EDM[](<#tips-for-optimizing-suno-prompts-for-edm>)

To get the best results when creating EDM with Suno, consider these tips for your suno prompts:

  * Specify EDM sub-genres \(e.g., “future bass”, “big room”, “tropical house”\)
  * Include iconic EDM instruments in your prompts \(e.g., “saw wave synth”, “808 kick”, “sidechained pads”\)
  * Describe the desired energy and mood \(e.g., “euphoric”, “intense”, “uplifting”\)
  * Reference popular EDM tracks or producers for inspiration
  * Use specific tempo ranges in your prompts \(e.g., “128 BPM EDM track”\)



## Conclusion[](<#conclusion>)

By combining Splice’s high-quality samples with Suno’s AI music generation and carefully crafted suno prompts, you can create compelling EDM tracks that blend classic elements with innovative sounds. Experiment with different combinations of samples, layer various EDM elements, and fine-tune your suno prompts to produce unique and energetic electronic dance music that will ignite the dance floor.

Remember, the key to great EDM is in the build-up of energy and the impact of the drop. Don’t be afraid to experiment with different rhythms, melodies, and sound design techniques to find your unique EDM sound. Happy producing\!
