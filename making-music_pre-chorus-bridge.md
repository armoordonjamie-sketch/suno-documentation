# Pre-chorus and Bridge in Suno Prompts

## Using Pre-chorus and Bridge for Stray Lyrics[](<#using-pre-chorus-and-bridge-for-stray-lyrics>)

`Pre-chorus` and `bridge` are for stray lyrics outside the main pattern. They build anticipation as the song transitions, and often don’t rhyme or appear to fit the meter.

Use the following metatags to label these sections:
    
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    [Bridge]

## Handling AI-generated Lyrics without Labels[](<#handling-ai-generated-lyrics-without-labels>)

AI-generated lyrics sometimes include a pre-chorus without labeling it, causing Suno to sing it as an awkward extra line that doesn’t fit the meter.

Adding a metatag label tells Suno this break in the song pattern is intentional, and it should be sung as its own pattern.

## Example: Lyrics Generated by AI[](<#example-lyrics-generated-by-ai>)

Here’s an example of lyrics generated by AI:
    
    
    [Verse]
    Wandering through the forest, lost and alone
    Shadows creeping, the unknown has grown
    Twisting paths, a labyrinth of trees
    Every clearing, a deceptive tease
    Fear is rising, it's clouding my mind
    
    [Chorus]
    Stumbling in darkness, searching for a way
    I'm losing hope, running out of day

Edited to add a \[Pre-chorus\]:
    
    
    [Verse]
    Wandering through the forest, lost and alone
    Shadows creeping, the unknown has grown
    Twisting paths, a labyrinth of trees
    Every clearing, a deceptive tease
    
    [Pre-chorus]
    **Fear is rising, it's clouding my mind**
    
    [Chorus]
    Stumbling in darkness, searching for a way
    I'm losing hope, running out of day

## Using Pre-chorus and Bridge in Different Positions[](<#using-pre-chorus-and-bridge-in-different-positions>)

Pre-chorus is a lead-in to a chorus. A bridge can go anywhere. It may be enough to simply set apart the lyrics with any descriptive tag:
    
    
    [Shout]
    [Whimsical]
    [Melancholy]
